/** A Bloom filter for integers.
 * 
 * <P>Instances of this class represent a set of integers (with false positives)
 * using a Bloom filter. Because of the way Bloom filters work,
 * you cannot remove elements.
 *
 * <P>Bloom filters have an expected error rate, depending on the number
 * of hash functions used, on the filter size and on the number of elements in the filter. This implementation
 * uses a variable optimal number of hash functions, depending on the expected
 * number of elements. More precisely, a Bloom
 * filter for <var>n</var> integers with <var>d</var> hash functions will use 
 * ln 2 <var>d</var><var>n</var> &#8776; 1.44 <var>d</var><var>n</var> bits;
 * false positives will happen with probability 2<sup>-<var>d</var></sup>.  
 *
 * <P>Hash functions are generated at creation time using universal hashing. Each hash function
 * uses two integers <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, and the integer <var>x</var> is mapped
 * to (<var>Ax</var>)&#8853;<var>B</var> before taking the remainder modulo the number of bits 
 * in the filter.
 * 
 * <P>This class exports access methods that are very similar to those of {@link java.util.Set},
 * but it does not implement that interface, as too many non-optional methods
 * would be unimplementable (e.g., iterators).
